## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

import HeaderLink from '@/components/layout/HeaderLink.astro';

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
	Embedded component in MDX
</HeaderLink>
